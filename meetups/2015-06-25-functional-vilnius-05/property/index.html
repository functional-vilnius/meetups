## Managers are happy

- Pay money and get result (as ordinary dev)

- Fresh blood

- Heavy activity

## Devs have open questions:

- Support

- Acceptance
---
# Outsourcing

## Project requirements

1. Extract a part of API to a separate project

2. Switch storage (Cassandra to Aerospike)

3. "Just change the url" replacement

---
# Outsourcing

## Why this might be a problem?

- Cassandra has a well defined query result ordering

- Cassandra has compound keys

- Cassandra has filtering (WHERE key_part = ...)

---
# Outsourcing

## But all Aerospike has is:

- Binary keys

- Secondary index
---
# Tracking Point Api

## Endpoints:

- Add TP data for cookie_id

- Delete by cookie_id

- Delete by cookie_id and setup_id

- Get by cookie_id

- Get by cookie_id and setup_id
---
# Tracking Point Api

## Writes

```haskell
data TrackingPoint = TrackingPoint {
    _cookie_id :: CookieId
  , _setup_id :: SetupId
  , _point_id :: PointId
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
```
---
# Tracking Point Api

## Reads

```haskell
data CookieTrackingSetups = CookieTrackingSetups {
    _cts_cookie_id :: CookieId
  , _cts_visits :: [TrackingSetup]
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)

data TrackingSetup = TrackingSetup {
    _ts_setup_id :: SetupId
  , _ts_point_ids :: [VisitedTrackingPoint]
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)

data VisitedTrackingPoint = VisitedTrackingPoint {
    _vtp_id :: PointId
  , _vtp_date :: UTCTime
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
```

# Quickcheck

## What it actually does:

- Generates _random_ (arbitrary) data

- Checks corner cases well

- Can automagically simplify failing cases
---
# Quickcheck

## What it actually does:

- Generates _random_ (arbitrary) data

- Checks corner cases well

- Can automagically simplify failing cases

## Why it is useful:

It can generate tests _data_ for us, so we can check if property holds:
```haskell
prop_revapp xs ys = reverse (xs++ys) == reverse xs ++ reverse ys
```
---
# Quickcheck

## Generate random TP data

```haskell
instance Arbitrary TrackingPoint where
  arbitrary = TrackingPoint <$> arbitrary <*> arbitrary <*> arbitrary
```

## Remember request fields?

```haskell
data TrackingPoint = TrackingPoint {
    _cookie_id :: CookieId
  , _setup_id :: SetupId
  , _point_id :: PointId
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
```
---
# Quickcheck

## Check reads and writes

### Arbitrary writes

```haskell
TQC.testProperty "writes" $
  \tp -> monadicIO $ do
    s <- run $ postTrackingPoint url tp
    assert $ s == 200
```
---
# Quickcheck

## Check reads and writes

### Arbitrary writes

```haskell
TQC.testProperty "writes" $
  \tp -> monadicIO $ do
    s <- run $ postTrackingPoint url tp
    assert $ s == 200
```

Not so useful, uh?

---
# Quickcheck

## Check reads and writes

### Arbitrary reads

```haskell
TQC.testProperty "reads by cookie" $
  \tp -> monadicIO $ do
    let c = TP._cookie_id tp
    response <- run $ getTrackingPoint url c
    assert $ TP._cts_cookie_id response == c
```

### Remember response fields?

```haskell
data CookieTrackingSetups = CookieTrackingSetups {
    _cts_cookie_id :: CookieId
  , _cts_visits :: [TrackingSetup]
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
```
---
# Quickcheck

## Test scenarios

These gets and posts are primitives for more complicated scenarios, i.e.

1. Delete all data for cookie_id

2. Write data for cookie_id

3. Get and check data

Or:

1. Delete all data for cookie_id

2. Write data for cookie_id

3. Delete data for cookie_id and setup_id

4. Get and check data

---
# Quickcheck

## Storage mutation

```haskell
data TrackingPointMutation =
    Post TrackingPoint
  | DeleteAll CookieId
  | Delete CookieId SetupId
  deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
```

## Arbitrary mutation chain

```haskell
instance Arbitrary TrackingPointMutation where
  arbitrary = oneof [post, delAll, del]
    where
      tp = arbitrary
      post = Post <$> tp
      delAll = DeleteAll <$> fmap _cookie_id tp
      del = Delete <$> (fmap _cookie_id tp) <*> (fmap _setup_id tp)
```
---
# Quickcheck

## Unified test

```haskell
TQC.testProperty "Random mutation chain" $
  \allActions -> monadicIO $ do
    let actions = take 5 allActions
    run $ mapM_ (deleteTrackingPointForCookie url) $ map key actions
    let f (TP.DeleteAll c) = deleteTrackingPointForCookie url c
        f (TP.Delete c s) = deleteTrackingPoint url c s
        f (TP.Post tp) = postTrackingPoint url tp
    run $ mapM_ f actions
    let replayed = replayTrackingPoint actions
    afters <- mapM (\c -> run $ getTrackingPoint url c) $ map key replayed
    assert $ replayed == afters
```

## Reference implementation of api

```haskell
replayTrackingPoint :: [TrackingPointMutation] -> [CookieTrackingSetups]
```

# Quickcheck

## Generated data

```haskell
[]
[DeleteAll (CookieId 0),
  DeleteAll (CookieId 2)]
[DeleteAll (CookieId 1)]
[]
[DeleteAll (CookieId 0),
  DeleteAll (CookieId 2),
  Post (TrackingPoint {_cookie_id = CookieId 2,
    _setup_id = SetupId 1, _point_id = PointId 4})]
[Post (TrackingPoint {_cookie_id = CookieId (-4),
    _setup_id = SetupId (-3), _point_id = PointId (-2)}),
  Post (TrackingPoint {_cookie_id = CookieId (-5),
    _setup_id = SetupId 4, _point_id = PointId 0}),
  Delete (CookieId 5) (SetupId (-4)),
  DeleteAll (CookieId 2),
  DeleteAll (CookieId (-7))]
```
---
# Quickcheck

## How can we fix it

- Make cookie_id constant in some cases

- Use fixed range values for cookie_id and setup_id

- We want testing to be not random but exhaustive
---
# Smallcheck

## Checks quantifiers:

- for all

- exists

- exists unique

  series = TrackingPoint <$> series <~> series <~> series
```

  series = cons1 Post \/ cons1 DeleteAll \/ cons2 Delete

# Takeaways

## There are two approaches to property testing:

- QuickCheck: if it fails, it fails on a random set of data

- Smallcheck: if it fails, if fails on a very small set of data

i.e. ScalaCheck + smallcheck4scala for Scala
